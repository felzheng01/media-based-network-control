This project was created as a culmination of my research in the Intel-UNC-Chapel Hill REU 2024. The program monitors an access point to predict what kinds of media devices connected to the access point are engaging in.
It then deauthenticates any devices using video or audio media. Here is a link to my final presentation, including a demo of the program: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lZXAYgyIH-BlG-svMHYrvkPWH2TkRRsJnZyxWtTEWb0/edit?usp=sharing

Thank you to my mentors Saba Eskandarian, Daniel Dinu, and Matthew Gregoriore for all of their help throughout this experience!
